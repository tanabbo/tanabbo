Ver 1.26
_calcMachineLearning reverted to use raster samples.
Flag -b used to balance samples.
Original rasters used instead of normalized ones.


Ver 1.25
_calcMachineLearning changed to use vector samples.
Problem with oversampled presence points occured.
r.learn.ml cannot accepted multiple points.
Procedure _getTrainingSamples created. Generates vector training samples for specified training years.


Ver 1.24
Updated samples generator.
Presence and absence samples are unique for all years.
They can be combined/accumulated without loss of samples.

Control set contains equal number of absence and presence points. 
Number of control points is (1-trainingPercentage)*nSpots.

Training set contains equal number of absence and presence points, but multiplied by a given coefficient.
Number of training points is multiplicator*trainingPercentage*nSpots.
Oversampling of presence points is used in training vector samples.
Trainig vector files contain duplicated (oversampled) presence samples.
Raster samples files cannot contain duplicates.

Samples export was updated.
Control and training samples are exported to CSV files.
